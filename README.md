# C-

I am new to C++. I know a small percentage of html, php, python and now I am going to fully commit to learning C++.
I work as a Network Architect and Installer. Network+, A+, CCNA, and currently taking Cyber Security. Ive been working
with Networks since highschool and I'm always looking to learn more. Recently learned Binary ASCII and Hexadecimal. I found
Github because I actually use Linux on my laptop. Currently running Parrot OS https://parrotsec.org/. I use Nmap, 
Metasploit, Wireshark, And many other tools that are provided. I am intrested in joining the Github community.

I am using this repository to hold what I am learning starting from the beginning. I am just using what I can find online
and what I do is I read first then I apply what I read test and keep going. I found that the way i learn I have to step by
step practice what I learn. I am currently using https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/variables-literals and I have 
this other resource that I can use also, https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp. I use Atom to write and exicute my code. 
I would like from the community or whoever is willing to look at my stuff and if their is any adjustments, formating , 
or just knowledge that you would like to add to the workspace please do. Im looking for knowledge asignments and good advice
from the community.
